                    <p className='py-5'>I am a dedicated student pursuing Full Stack Development at Business College Helsinki, with a passion for technology 
                                        and innovation. I am believer and have faith in power of trust and second chances. As I am near completion of my studies,

                    <p className='py-5'>My journey into the world of programming began just over a year ago. Since then, I have been on an exciting path of 
                                        discovery and growth. I have always been fascinated by technology and its ever-evolving nature. This fascination, 
                                        coupled with my natural problem-solving abilities, led me to explore the field of Full Stack Development.
                    </p>
                    <p className='py-5'>I've had the privilege of learning from incredible teachers and collaborating with supportive friends who have played a 
                                        significant role in shaping my journey.I have proficiency in HTML, CSS, React.js, JavaScript, PHP (Symfony), Tailwind CSS, 
                                        Bootstrap, Drupal. Along with these I also have some basic knowledge of Next.js and Typescript. I have used technologies 
                                        like Docker, Figma, Trello, Github, AWS, CI/CD pipeline etc.
                    </p>

                                        in a professional environment. I thrive in collaborative settings, eager to tackle challenges, and contribute innovative solutions 
                                        to projects. Outside of coding, I enjoy watching movies, travelling to new places, fishing, camping and watch camping and survival videos.

                                        adaptability and flexibility, communication, empathy, time management and continuous learning etc from my past work life which 
                                        for sure can be used anywhere in any career. My works were complete and tidy so my superiors were always happy with my performance.
