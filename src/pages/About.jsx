                        I'm an enthusiastic Full Stack Development student at Business College Helsinki, driven by a deep passion for <mark className='bg-yellow-200'>technology
                         and innovation</mark>. As I near the end of my studies,

                        My journey into programming began just over a year ago, sparking a thrilling 
                        path of discovery. The ever-evolving nature of <mark className='bg-yellow-200'>technology</mark> and my 
                        innate <mark className='bg-yellow-200'>problem-solving abilities</mark> led me to Full Stack Development.
                    </p>
                    <p className='py-3 text-lg dark:font-light'>
                        Guided by exceptional teachers and supported by collaborative friends, I've honed
                        proficiency in <mark className='bg-yellow-200'>HTML, CSS, React.js, JavaScript, PHP (Symfony), Tailwind CSS, 
                        Bootstrap, Drupal</mark>. I also possess basic knowledge of <mark className='bg-yellow-200'>Next.js and 
                        Typescript</mark>, and have hands-on experience with <mark className='bg-yellow-200'>Docker, Figma, Trello, Github, 
                        AWS, and CI/CD pipeline</mark>.

                        watching movies to exploring new places, fishing, and camping activities that fuel my creativity.

                        Before venturing into development, my background in the cleaning and property maintenance sector
